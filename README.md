Science_Chemistry
=================

General classes to represent Atoms, Molecules and Macromolecules.  Also
parsing code for PDB, CML and XYZ file formats.  Examples of parsing and
conversion to/from chemical structure formats. Includes a utility class with
information on the Elements in the Periodic Table.

This is old code I wrote for [PEAR](http://pear.php.net). 
Originally it was tracked in CVS, then it was moved to SVN, 
and now I am importing it to git :-)
